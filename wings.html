        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
                <p>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
                <p>Place chicken wings in a single layer in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle flour mixture over top and toss until wings are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
                <p>Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely.)</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
                <p>While the oil is coming to temperature, combine butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until butter is melted and mixture is thoroughly blended. Remove from the heat and reserve for serving.</p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
                <p>Fry coated wings in the hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they begin to crisp and turn brown. Maintain the oil temperature while cooking.</p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
                <p>Remove wings from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate.</p>
            <li>Step 7</li>
                <p>Transfer wings to a platter and drizzle hot sauce over top; or mix wings and hot sauce in a bowl until coated. Serve.</p>
